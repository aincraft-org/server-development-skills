description: Use when setting up or editing GitHub Actions CI, choosing project versioning, configuring CalVer releases or nightly builds, publishing release artifacts, or adding README shields.io badges. Triggers include CI workflow files, GitHub Actions schedules, rolling nightly releases, CalVer, release tags, build-status badges, license badges, and platform badges.

# CI and Release Engineering

Required conventions for projects maintained by these skills:

- Project versions use CalVer: **`YYYY.MM.DD.<github_run_number>`** in GitHub Actions.
- Every project has a scheduled nightly release published as a rolling `nightly` pre-release.
- Public-project READMEs use shields.io badges; private or internal projects do not.

Pins verified 2026-08-21 against the official action repositories and Shields.io documentation.

## Action pins

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| `actions/checkout` | **v7** |
| `actions/setup-java` | **v5** |
| `gradle/actions/setup-gradle` | **v6** |
| Java toolchain | **25** |

Use the current major pins above. Re-verify them against the upstream release pages before changing them.

## CalVer

The canonical CI version is date plus the GitHub Actions run number:

```text
2026.08.21.142
YYYY.MM.DD.<github_run_number>
```

Use this Gradle Kotlin DSL version provider (the `project-setup` skill includes the same source-of-truth snippet):

```kotlin
val calverDate = java.time.LocalDate.now(java.time.ZoneOffset.UTC)
    .format(java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy.MM.dd"))

version = providers.gradleProperty("buildVersion")
    .orElse(
        providers.environmentVariable("GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER")
            .map { "$calverDate.$it" }
    )
    .orElse("$calverDate-SNAPSHOT")
    .get()
```

`buildVersion` is an explicit release override. Normal CI derives the run number from `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`; local builds use a dated `-SNAPSHOT` fallback. Stable release tags MUST equal the full built version, not a shortened date.

If a generated artifact contains a manifest or plugin descriptor with its own version, expand that value from Gradle's `version`; never maintain a second hardcoded version.

## Build workflow

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v5
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: '25'
      - uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v6
      - run: ./gradlew build spotlessCheck
```

Keep the formatting/style gate in the CI command. A build that compiles but skips the repository's style check is not a passing CI contract.

## Rolling nightly release

Create `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`:

```yaml
name: Nightly release

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 4 * * *' # 04:00 UTC every day
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  nightly:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v5
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: '25'
      - uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v6
      - run: ./gradlew build spotlessCheck
      - name: Replace rolling nightly release
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
        run: |
          gh release delete nightly --cleanup-tag --yes || true
          gh release create nightly build/libs/*.jar \
            --prerelease \
            --title "Nightly $(date -u +%F)" \
            --notes "Automated nightly build from ${GITHUB_SHA}."
```

The `nightly` tag MUST be replaced, not reused at an old commit. The release MUST remain a pre-release. `workflow_dispatch` makes the same path manually testable without waiting for the cron schedule.

## Stable release

Stable releases use the exact CalVer version built by the workflow. A release workflow may be manual or tag-driven; the build override avoids a version mismatch at the date boundary:

```yaml
- name: Build release
  run: |
    VERSION="$(date -u +%Y.%m.%d).${GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER}"
    ./gradlew -PbuildVersion="$VERSION" build spotlessCheck
    echo "VERSION=$VERSION" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"

- name: Publish release
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
  run: gh release create "$VERSION" build/libs/*.jar --title "$VERSION" --generate-notes
```

Stable releases are not marked `--prerelease`; their tag is the full `YYYY.MM.DD.<github_run_number>` value. The shell format uses UTC and `date -u +%Y.%m.%d`, matching the Gradle formatter above.

## README badges

Add shields.io badges **only when the repository is public**. Do not add them to private or internal repositories.

For a public project, include:

- CI/build status.
- License.
- Current release when the project publishes releases.
- Platform or target runtime when applicable. For a binary, show supported OS/architecture targets; for a Paper plugin, show the supported Paper/Minecraft version.

Replace `OWNER`, `REPO`, and workflow filenames with the project's values:

```markdown
[![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/OWNER/REPO/ci.yml?branch=main&label=build)](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/OWNER/REPO)](LICENSE)
[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/OWNER/REPO)](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases/latest)
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-26.2-blue)
```

The workflow-status badge path uses the workflow filename (`ci.yml`), not the workflow's display name. Omit the platform badge when the project has no meaningful runtime or binary target.

## Verify

```bash
./gradlew build spotlessCheck
```

For a public repository, manually dispatch `nightly.yml` once after adding it. Confirm that the build succeeds, the release is marked pre-release, the `nightly` tag points at the new commit, and the README badges resolve.

## Common mistakes

| Wrong | Right | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `1.0.0` or another SemVer-only project version | `YYYY.MM.DD.<github_run_number>` | CalVer is the repository release convention and run numbers make same-day builds unique |
| `LocalDate.now().toString()` for the version date | UTC date formatted as `yyyy.MM.dd` | ISO hyphens violate the required dotted CalVer format |
| Dated nightly releases with an unbounded release list | Replace the rolling `nightly` pre-release | Consumers get one stable download target and the release list stays usable |
| Reusing the old `nightly` tag without moving it | Delete the release/tag, then recreate it | A reused tag can leave users downloading an old commit |
| Missing `contents: write` on the nightly job | Grant write permission only to the release workflow | GitHub refuses to create or replace releases without it |
| `github/workflow/status/...` badge URL | `github/actions/workflow/status/.../<workflow>.yml` | Shields.io uses the workflow-file endpoint |
| Badges in a private repository | No shields.io badges for private/internal projects | Public badge endpoints cannot reliably resolve private metadata |
| Hardcoded versions in both Gradle and a descriptor | Expand the descriptor from Gradle `version` | Two version sources drift |
| CI runs `build` but not `spotlessCheck` | Run `./gradlew build spotlessCheck` | A compiling build can still violate the repository's style gate |
